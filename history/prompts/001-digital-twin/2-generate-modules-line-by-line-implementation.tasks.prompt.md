## Summary

User requested to generate modules line by line (module 1, module 2, module 3, module 4) and the implementation process was initiated using /sp.implement.

## Context

User wanted to generate modules sequentially and the system began the implementation process, checking prerequisites, analyzing implementation context, and preparing to execute the tasks.

## Solution

The implementation system checked prerequisites, analyzed the implementation context, and began the execution process following the task plan structure.

## Outcome

The implementation process was initiated successfully with proper setup verification and task execution planning.

## Prompt Text

```
please generate module line by kine for example module 1 module 2 ,module 3 module 4 line by line
```

## Response Text

```
The implementation process has been initiated. The system is checking prerequisites, analyzing implementation context, and preparing to execute tasks following the proper sequence. The process will verify project setup, check ignore files, parse tasks.md structure, and execute implementation following the task plan with proper phase-by-phase execution and validation checkpoints.
