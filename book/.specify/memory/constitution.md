# AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation: Write a book using Docusaurus and deploy it to GitHub Pages. Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Accuracy through verification
All factual claims and instructions must be traceable to official documentation and primary sources. A minimum of 50% of sources must be from official tool documentation and repositories (e.g., Docusaurus, Spec-Kit Plus, Claude Code), supplemented with peer-reviewed articles on AI-driven development. Plagiarism check must show 0% tolerance before final deployment.

### II. Clarity for technical audience
Content must be clear and understandable for developers and AI enthusiasts with a software engineering background. Writing clarity should adhere to Flesch-Kincaid grade 10-12, with clear headings, code blocks, and diagrams where applicable. Citation format must use Markdown links for inline references within Docusaurus pages.

### III. Reproducibility
All code examples, setup instructions, and processes must be executable and verifiable.

### IV. Rigor
Adhere to best practices in spec-driven development, documentation, and deployment.

### V. Book Structure
The book must be a multi-page Docusaurus site with at least 5 chapters/sections.

### VI. Tools Usage
Exclusively use Spec-Kit Plus for the spec-driven workflow and Claude Code for AI-assisted coding.

## Constraints

- Book structure: Multi-page Docusaurus site with at least 5 chapters/sections
- Tools usage: Exclusively use Spec-Kit Plus for spec-driven workflow and Claude Code for AI-assisted coding
- Deployment: Hosted on GitHub Pages
- Minimum 10 sources referenced

## Success Criteria

- Book successfully deployed to GitHub Pages with functional navigation and search
- All content verified against sources for accuracy
- Zero plagiarism detected via standard tools
- Passes internal review for clarity, reproducibility, and adherence to principles

## Governance

The constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan. All PRs/reviews must verify compliance. Complexity must be justified.
