# Module 1: Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1, where you will dive into the foundational concepts of the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2). ROS 2 is an open-source middleware that provides a flexible framework for writing robot software. It enables different components of a robot system to communicate and coordinate.

In this module, you will learn about:

*   ROS 2 nodes, topics, services: The core communication mechanisms in ROS 2.
*   Python integration with ROS (rclpy): How to write ROS 2 applications using Python.
*   URDF for humanoids: Describing the physical and kinematic properties of your humanoid robot using the Unified Robot Description Format.

By the end of this module, you will have a solid understanding of how to build the "nervous system" for your robots, enabling them to perceive, process, and act within their environment.
